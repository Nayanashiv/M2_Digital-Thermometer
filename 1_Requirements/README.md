Components required for the project are:
LM35:
LM35 is a Precision temperature sensor IC with its output proportional to the temperature (in degree Celsius). LM35 is capable of giving accurate temperature readings compared to thermistor. The senor is sealed to avoid the effects of oxidation and other factors. It operates at a temperature range of -55°c to 150°c. The output voltage varies by 10mV in response to every °C rise or fall in atmospheric temperature.

16×2 LCD:
LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is widely used electronic display module and got a wide range of applications. A 16×2 LCD consists of 16 columns and 2 rows thereby it is capable of displaying 16 characters in a single line. It consists of two registers, Command register used to store the command instructions given to the LCD. Whereas Data Register used to store the data’s to be displayed in the LCD.

ATmega328 is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed. Perhaps the most common implementation of this chip is on the popular Arduino development platform, namely the Arduino Uno, Arduino Pro Mini[4] and Arduino Nano models.
